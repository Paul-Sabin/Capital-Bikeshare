# Capital Bikeshare Data Analysis and Bike Demand Prediction at Rush hour Project
## Description
This project focuses on analyzing datasets provided by Capital Bikeshare, a bike-sharing company founded in the US precisely Washington DC. Through a series of data wrangling, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning (ML) techniques, valuable insights were extracted from the data.

## Key Highlights
+  Conducted thorough data wrangling and data cleaning to ensure data quality and accuracy.
* Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships within the dataset.
*  Utilized machine learning algorithms to develop predictive models to forecast bike demand during rush hours, enhancing resource allocation and operational efficiency.
*  Created visually appealing and informative geographical visualizations to better understand the data and consumer behavior.
*  By applying these techniques, we gained valuable insights into bike usage patterns, user preferences, and other important factors that can drive business decisions for Capital Bikeshare.
*  Several models were used ranging from Linear regression, Polynomial regression, Random Forest, etc. And evaluation metrics used for models were MSE and R2.
* Polynomial regression, due to the fact that it understands non-linearity between features as well as complex patterns, performed better than Linear regression.  

* It was discovered that the new Generation E-Bike that was launched  in the spring of 2023 influenced The growth rate of ride likewise increased the rides made by registered bike users
